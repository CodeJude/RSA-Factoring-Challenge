# RSA Factoring Challenge

This is an ALX SE Program Challenge

The RSA Factoring Challenge was a challenge put forward by RSA Laboratories on March 18, 1991 to encourage research into computational number theory and the practical difficulty of factoring large integers and cracking RSA keys used in cryptography ðŸ’»

This repo is just an attempt to read in and factorize a file of numbers.

## Description of what each file shows:
* factors - the program to factorize (Usage: time ./factors tests/test00)
* tests/test00 - the file with the numbers

## Environment
* Language: Bash script
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
